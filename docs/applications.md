# Applications

Most applications are installed via Brew casks in the [laptop
script](../laptop) ([see Brewfile](../brewfile)). Manually install the following applications that are not
available as casks:

* Bear -- notes for work
* Magnet -- position windows
* Meeter -- meeting reminders and join links
* Sip -- color picker

## App configuration

### Configure Magnet

Set the following keyboard mappings in Preferences:

* Left: cmd+opt+H
* Right: cmd+opt+L
* Up: cmd+opt+K
* Down: cmd+opt+J
* Maximize: cmd+opt+F
* Restore: cmd+opt+R

### Configure Karabiner Elements

* Go to Complex Modifications -> Add Rule -> Import from Internet
* Import “Change caps_lock key (rev 5)
* Enable rule: “Change caps_lock to control if pressed with other keys, to escape if pressed alone.”

### Configure Apptivate

Set up shortcuts for Chrome (cmd+space), Mail (“ctrl+a, M”), iTerm (“ctrl+a, T”), Slack (“ctrl+a, S”), Finder, 1Password, Spotify, VS Code, Notion, Messages, Calendar, Zoom, “Connect to JBL Charge 3” (script). All shortcuts are chorded starting with “ctrl+a” except Chrome

### Configure Chrome

Set up two profiles called Work and Personal. Add keyboard shortcuts ctrl+s ("Stephen (Personal)") and ctrl+w ("Stephen (Work)") for launching the profiles in System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Keyboard Shortcuts

### Configure 1Password

Find the Personal vault in Dropbox->Apps->1Password. Also use the "1Password - requires desktop app" browser extension.

### Configure VS Code

See my [VSCode instructions](./vscode).
